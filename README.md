# TumorCNN

- Medical check-ups at times can be very time consuming and costly. For example, if a patient needs to get checked up for a possible Brain Tumor condition then the patient has to go through multiple layers of processing to get the final result.

- But not anymore. With our revolutionary and carefully designed platform, we can detect the Brain Tumor’s possible presence in a patient within mere minutes. Even early-stage presence of Brain Tumor can be detected using our platform which might get unnoticed even by neurosurgery specialist. 

- Our platform works using machine learning, which is first trained using specially designed data sets and using algorithms and statistical models to analyse and conclude results. 

- Now the platform is ready and can give the result of a patient’s condition after just getting an MRI scan using an MRI machine and using scanned images to be used as an input to our trained machine learning-based platform and getting results after being precisely analysed within seconds. 

- The machine uses CNN ( convolutional neural network) to analyse the image and give results using the prediction data to a maximum of 97 to 100 % accuracy. 

- This can save the precious time of the patient while being cost-friendly by saving resources on unnecessary labour and multiple layers of the gruelling procedure.
